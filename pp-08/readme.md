# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral:This solar power bank is user friendly and nature friendly

* Behavioral: I have used many power bank before, however this power bank does what it says very well. It changes my phone 100% in one hour has it promise before i brought it. 

* Reflective: This solar power bank is very well designed with the solar solar panel on top and a holder to hold phones.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1.Simple and very usefull
2.A website that easy to use and works correctly.
3.Well designed page thats easy on eye
