# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/interaction/navigation/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: We added a navigation bar because it lets people quickly and easily switch between categories, regardless of the current location.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-controls/buttons/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: WE want to use "Use verbs in titles" An action-specific title shows that a button is interactive and says what happens when you tap it. This will help new coming student understand the website well.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-bars/search-bars/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Adding a search icon on our website will help the student to search whatever he/she is looking for quickly.
